# AI Agent Research - Database

This is my simple RAG AI agent research project. The project is a simple web server that can handle the request from the client and response with the result of the RAG AI agent.

## Quick start

Simply run the following command, Docker Compose will handle the rest for you.

```bash
docker compose up
```

You can modify the docker-compose.yaml file to change some configurations like the port, username, and password of the Postgres server.
